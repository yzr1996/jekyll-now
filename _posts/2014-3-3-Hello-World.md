**Customer segmentation: how machine learning helps your business**

Imagine that you opened a convenience store in a university 3 years ago, and every year the store could bring you a considerable revenue. Recently, you decided to open a new convenience store in a very crowded mall. From the last 3 years lessons, you are now quite experienced in inventory management of a convenience store. However, can you directly copy the inventory list from the convenience store to the new opened one? Obviously, no, since in the past the majority customers are university students, now the target customers changed. We all know the importance of providing the services tailored to customersâ€™ needs and interests, but it is not an easy thing to do. In this case, customer segmentation allows you to do so. 

The technique of customer segmentation appeared earlier than the machine learning. It was previously a challenging and time-consuming task, which requires to handle and compute tons of data manually and due the limitation of human beings, the outcomes are not always ideal. But in recent years it has become much easier thanks to machine learning. Today, I will explain the concepts behind the screen by using machine learning models to segment customers.
Let us start with the definition of the machine learning. Machine learning is teaching computers how to solve certain questions. In this post, the question is separating the customers into different groups. Where do computers learn from? The answer is data, usually the data with huge size. In our case, the ideal data should contain thousands of rows, and each row saves the order information of a customer, like something below,
